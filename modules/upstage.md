title: The Upstage Module

<img class="panel" src="panel.svg" alt="The Upstage Panel" />

Adds special-purpose controls
for envelopes generated by
[Stage](/modules/stage/),
[Booster Stage](/modules/booster-stage/),
and
[Hostage](/modules/hostage/)
modules.

Combine
[Stage]({{ '/modules/stage/' | relative_url }}),
[Booster Stage]({{ '/modules/booster-stage/' | relative_url }}),
[Hostage]({{ '/modules/hostage/' | relative_url }}),
and [Upstage]({{ '/modules/upstage/' | relative_url }})
modules
to generate complex envelopes
with any number of stages.

Use an _Upstage_ module to:

- Set the starting voltage for an envelope.
- Manually trigger an envelope.
- Configure an envelope that automatically retriggers when it completes.
- Suppress incoming triggers while an envelope is in progress.

## Controls

- **LEVEL:**
    The voltage sent to the _OUT_ output.

    The polarity switch **(UNI / BI)**
    selects the range of the _LEVEL_ knob:
    Either unipolar control voltage (0 to 10V)
    or bipolar control voltage (-5 to 5V).

    The _LEVEL_ knob is modulated by the **CV** input.
    The modulation is calibrated so that:
    - A 0V _CV_ signal yields the value
        of the knob's current position.
    - A 5V _CV_ signal yields the value
        as if the knob were rotated 50%
        clockwise
        of its actual position.
    - A -5V _CV_ signal yields the value
        as if the knob were rotated 50%
        counterclockwise
        of its actual position.

- **WAIT button:**
    Suppresses triggers
    from both the _TRIG_ input and the _TRIG_ button.

- **TRIG button:**
    While pressed,
    offers 10V to the _TRIG_ output.
    While not pressed, offers 0V.

    This button is ignored
    if the _WAIT_ gate signal is high
    or the _WAIT_ button is pressed.

### Ports

- **WAIT:**
    A gate signal that, when high,
    suppresses incoming triggers
    from both the _TRIG_ input and the _TRIG_ button.

- **TRIG (input):**
    The incoming trigger signal
    offered to the _TRIG_ output.

    This signal is ignored
    if the _WAIT_ gate signal is high
    or the _WAIT_ button is pressed.

- **TRIG (output):**
    Emits either the _TRIG_ input signal
    or the _TRIG_ button voltage,
    whichever is greater.

    If the _WAIT_ gate signal is high
    or the _WAIT_ button is pressed,
    this output emits 0V
    regardless of the value of
    _TRIG_ signal and the _TRIG_ button.

- **OUT:**
    Sends the voltage set by the (_CV_-modulated) _LEVEL_ knob.
