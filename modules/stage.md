*Stage* generates a single-stage envelope.
Combine *Stages*
to generate complex envelopes
with any number of stages.

## Controls

- **LEVEL:**
    The voltage level at which the envelope stage ends.
    The range is 0–10V.

- **CURVE:**
    The curvature of the envelope stage.
    The center position (no curvature)
    produces a linear stage.
    Positive curvature produces a J-shaped curve
    reminiscent of a "logarithmic" curve.
    Negative curvature produces an inverted J shape.
    At extreme positions the curvature is severe.

- **DURATION:**
    The duration of the envelope stage.
    The range is 10ms–10s,
    with the center position
    giving a duration of 1s.

## Inputs and Outputs

- **DEFER:**
    When the _DEFER_ gate signal is high,
    _Stage_ _defers_ to its _IN_ signal,
    forwarding the _IN_ signal
    directly to the _OUT_ output.
    While _Stage_ is deferring
    it ignores incoming triggers.
    When it begins deferring,
    _Stage_ abandons any envelope stage
    it may have been generating.

- **TRIG:**
    When it receives a trigger,
    _Stage_ begins generating an envelope stage
    (unless it is deferring).
    Each stage starts
    at the current voltage of the _IN_ signal.

- **IN:**
    When _Stage_ generates an envelope stage,
    the stage starts
    at the current voltage of the _IN_ signal.
    When _Stage_ is _deferring_,
    it forwards the _IN_ signal directly to its _OUT_ output.

- **ACTIVE:**
    A 10V gate signal indicating that this _Stage_
    is either actively generating an envelope stage
    or deferring to its _IN_ signal.

- **EOC:**
    When _Stage_ completes an envelope stage,
    it emits a 1 millisecond 10V pulse
    at its _EOC_ output.

- **OUT:**
    The envelope stage signal generated by _Stage_
    or (when deferring) the _IN_ signal.
