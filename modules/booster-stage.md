_Booster Stage_ enhances
_[Stage's]({{ '/modules/stage/' | relative_url }})_
functionality,
adding CV inputs,
sigmoid curves,
buttons to inject triggers and other control signals,
and more.

## Controls

- **LEVEL:**
    The voltage level at which the envelope stage ends.

    The polarity switch **(UNI / BI)**
    selects the range of the _LEVEL_ knob:
    Either unipolar control voltage (0 to 10V)
    or bipolar control voltage (-5 to 5V).

- **CURVE:**
    The curvature of the envelope stage.
    The center position (no curvature)
    produces a linear stage.
    Positive curvature produces an S- or J-shaped curve.
    Negative curvature produces an inverted S- or J-shaped curve.
    At extreme positions the curvature is severe.

    The shape switch **(S / J)**
    selects the shape of the envelope stage.
    _J_ selects a J-shaped curve
    reminiscent of a "logarithmic" curve.
    _S_ selects a sigmoid (S-shaped) curve.

- **DURATION:**
    The duration of the envelope stage.

    The duration switch **(1 / 10 / 100)**
    sets the maximum value (seconds) of the knob.
    The minimum value is 1/1000 of the maximum value.
    At the center position,
    the duration is 1/10 of the maximum.

- **Buttons:**
    The _DEFER_ and _TRIG_ inputs
    and the _ACTIVE_ and _EOC_ outputs
    each have an associated "manual override" button.
    While pressed,
    each button injects 10V into the associated signal
    (unless the signal is already greater than 10V).

## Inputs and Outputs

- **DEFER:**
    When the _DEFER_ gate signal is high,
    _Booster Stage_ _defers_ to its _IN_ signal,
    and forwarding the _IN_ signal
    directly to the _OUT_ output.
    While _Booster Stage_ is deferring
    it ignores incoming triggers.
    When it begins deferring,
     _Booster Stage_ abandons any envelope stage
    it may have been generating.

- **TRIG:**
    When it receives a trigger,
    _Booster Stage_ begins generating an envelope stage
    (unless it is deferring).
    Each stage starts
    at the current voltage of the _IN_ signal.

- **IN:**
    When _Booster Stage_ generates an envelope stage,
    the stage starts
    at the current voltage of the _IN_ signal.
    When _Booster Stage_ is _deferring_,
    it forwards the _IN_ signal directly to its _OUT_ output.

- **ACTIVE:**
    A 10V gate signal indicating that this _Booster Stage_
    is either actively generating an envelope stage
    or deferring to its _IN_ signal.

- **EOC:**
    When _Booster Stage_ completes an envelope stage,
    it emits a 1 millisecond 10V pulse
    at its _EOC_ output.

- **OUT:**
    The envelope stage signal generated by _Booster Stage_
    or (when deferring) the _IN_ signal.

- **CV:**
    Control voltage signal that modulates the associated knob.
    A 0V _CV_ signal yields the value of the knob.
    The modulation is calibrated
    so that
    a -5V _CV_ signal yields the knob's minimum value,
    and a 5V _CV_ signal yields its maximum value.
