Enhances [Stage's]({{ '/modules/stage/' | relative_url }}) functionality,
adding CV inputs,
sigmoid curves,
buttons to inject triggers and other control signals,
and more.

## Controls

- **LEVEL:**
    The ending level of the envelope stage.

    The polarity switch **(UNI / BI)**
    selects the range of the _LEVEL_ knob:
    Either unipolar control voltage (0 to 10V)
    or bipolar control voltage (-5 to 5V).

- **CURVE:**
    The curvature of the envelope stage.
    The center position (no curvature)
    produces a linear stage.
    Positive curvature produces an S- or J-shaped curve.
    Negative curvature produces an inverted S- or J-shaped curve.
    At extreme positions the curvature is severe.

    The shape switch **(S / J)**
    selects the shape of the envelope stage.
    _J_ selects a J-shaped curve
    reminiscent of a "logarithmic" curve.
    **S** selects a sigmoid (S-shaped) curve.

- **DURATION:**
    The duration of the envelope stage.

    The duration switch **(1 / 10 / 100)**
    sets the maximum value (seconds) of the knob.
    The minimum value is 1/1000 of the maximum value.
    At the center position,
    the duration is 1/10 of the maximum.

- **CV:**
    Control voltage signal added to the associated knob.
    With the knob centered,
    a -5V _CV_ signal yields the knob's minimum value,
    and a 5V _CV_ signal yields its maximum value.

- **Buttons:**
    The buttons next to the
    _DEFER, TRIG, ACTIVE,_ and _EOC_ ports
    manually inject 10V into the associated ports.

## Ports

- **DEFER:**
    A signal 1V or higher instructs _Booster Stage_
    to abandon any envelope stage in progress
    and to _defer_ to its input.
    While _Booster Stage_ is deferring,
    it ignores incoming triggers
    and sends its _IN_ signal
    directly to its _OUT_ port.

- **TRIG:**
    A rising edge triggers _Booster Stage_
    to generate an envelope stage
    (unless it is deferring).

- **IN:**
    When _Booster Stage_ generates an envelope stage,
    the stage starts at the voltage at the _IN_ port.
    When _Booster Stage_ is _deferring_,
    it sends the _IN_ signal directly to its _OUT_ port.

- **ACTIVE:**
    A 10V gate signal indicating that _Booster Stage_
    is either actively generating an envelope stage
    or deferring to its input.

- **EOC:**
    Emits a 10V, 1 millisecond pulse
    when _Booster Stage_ completes an envelope stage.

- **OUT:**
    The envelope signal generated by _Booster Stage_
    or (when deferring) the signal received at the _IN_ port.
