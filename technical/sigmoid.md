title: Normalized Tunable Sigmoid Function
---

As I looked for a way
to shape envelope stages,
I stumbled across Dino Dini's beautiful
_normalized tunable sigmoid function._

By _beautiful,_
I mean that it has three features
that make it enormously useful for my purposes:

- **[Sigmoid](#sigmoid):**
    It produces a particularly useful
    S-shaped curve.
- **[Tunable](#tunable):**
    A single parameter
    (_k_ or _curvature_)
    adjusts the curve
    in particularly useful ways.
- **[Normalized](#normalized):**
    It applies in a particularly useful way
    to numbers in two particularly useful ranges:
    \[-1,1\] and \[0,1\].
    And (bonus!):
    In the \[0,1\] range
    it produces a particularly useful
    J-shaped curve.
