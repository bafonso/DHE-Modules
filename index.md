## The Modules

**[Stage](modules/stage/)**
generates a single stage envelope.
Combine Stage modules
to generate complex envelopes
with any number of stages.

**[Booster Stage](modules/booster-stage/)**
enhances Stage's functionality,
adding CV inputs,
sigmoid curves,
buttons to inject triggers and other control signals,
and more.

**[Hostage](modules/hostage/)**
generates a hold (or sustain) stage
controlled by
either a gate signal
or a built-in timer.

**[Upstage](modules/upstage/)**
adds special-purpose envelope controls
to
inject triggers,
suppress retriggers,
set an envelope's starting voltage,
and more.

**[Swave](modules/swave/)**
is a waveshaper with a unique sigmoid transfer function.
