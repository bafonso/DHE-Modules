## The Modules

**[Stage]({% link modules/stage.md %})**
generates a single stage envelope.
Combine Stage modules
to generate complex envelopes
with any number of stages.


**[Booster Stage]({% link modules/booster-stage.md %})**
enhances Stage's functionality,
adding CV inputs,
sigmoid curves,
buttons to inject triggers and other control signals,
and more.

**[Hostage]({% link modules/hostage.md %})**
generates a sustain stage
controlled by
either a gate signal
or a built-in timer.

**[Upstage]({ link modules/upstage.md %})**
adds special-purpose envelope controls
to
inject triggers,
suppress retriggers,
set an envelope's starting voltage,
and more.

**[Swave]({% link modules/swave.md %})**
is a waveshaper with a unique sigmoid transfer function.
